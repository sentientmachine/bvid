# Epic idea hit me over the head, giving it voice here.

Make a web page where the user can be presented with a youtube video that they really would enjoy
and power a machine learning algorithm by the people choosing which one they like better.

I can assume that I have either a unique cookie identifying each individual user, or else their email/password.

The user is presented with two youtube videos (left and right) with a button underneath, and they 
can watch it, and or mark which one they like better.  When they choose, a log entry is created for them:
Xvideo is better than Yvideo.  This log is presented to them and a machine learning algorithm picks another
based on their choices hybrid with everyone else's choices.

The user can paste in a new youtube video and it is added to the slush pile for rating.
The user can click a button: "Show me another video", and another two are presented.  They can either
choose the one they like better, (for a reward) or else they can just say: "show me another".
If they click: "show me another" then it means the two videos presented get an upvote.
If the user does not click "show me another" the two videos presented to not receive an upvote.

I can seed my system with a shit-ton of youtube videos it keeps a list in the database of each video by votes.

Don't worry about money until I get a shit ton of users using this on a day to day basis.
No logins needed until I get attacked, then learning happens.

Later I can keep statistics and data about the youtube video and use it to decide if this particular 
user would like this particular video.
If the recommended videos are intoxicating enough and perfect enough, then I should be

User can click options like options, for what they want to search for.

Like randal Munroe's thefairest.com (site gone): that old xkcd's website presented the algorithm they 
used, exactly, find that old website from archive.  It's a not terrible idea but exhausts the search
space with time.
